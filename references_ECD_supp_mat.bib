  title     = "The dynamics of spatially coupled food webs",
  author    = "McCann, K S and Rasmussen, J B and Umbanhowar, J",
  abstract  = "The dynamics of ecological systems include a bewildering number
               of biotic interactions that unfold over a vast range of spatial
               scales. Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments
               concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and
               behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of
               space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue
               that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial
               structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses
               by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs.
               Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show
               that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in
               determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More
               specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order
               organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable,
               and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is
               compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local
               habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate
               destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show
               consistency with this general theory.",

  author   = "Sargent, Risa D and Otto, Sarah P",
  abstract = "We present a population genetic model that incorporates aspects
              of pollinator efficiency and abundance to examine the effect of
              the local plant community on the evolution of floral trait
              specialization. Our model predicts that plant species evolve to
              be pollinator specialists on the most effective and common
              pollinators when their abundance is low relative to other plant
              species in the community (i.e., conspecific pollen is relatively
              rare) and evolve to be pollinator generalists when they are
              numerically dominant (i.e., conspecific pollen is abundant).
              Strong flower constancy also favors generalist floral traits.
              Furthermore, generalist species are predicted to differentiate
              when there is a concave trade-off in attracting pollinator
              species with different floral trait preferences. This result
              implies that populations that evolve toward a generalist strategy
              may be more prone to speciation. Ours is the first theoretical
              model to include local species abundance explicitly, despite the
              fact that it has been previously identified as an important
              factor in the evolution of plant specialization. Our results add
              a layer of ecological complexity to previous models of floral
              evolution and therefore have the potential to improve our power
              to predict circumstances under which specialized and generalized
              plant-pollinator interactions should evolve.",

  author    = "Lawlor, Lawrence R and Smith, J Maynard",
  abstract  = "If two species compete for two renewable resources, will they
               coevolve so as to make continued coexistence more likely? This
               question is analyzed using the equations of MacArthur (1972) but
               allowing the constants in those equations to undergo
               evolutionary change, subject to constraints. Individual
               selection will cause these variables to take values which are
               evolutionarily stable, in the sense that if all individuals in a
               population have those values no mutant can invade it. It is then
               possible to compare the evolutionarily stable values for each
               species on its own with the values when they coexist. Two cases
               are considered: a coarse-grained case in which at any instant a
               consumer can search for one resource or the other but not for
               both, and a fine-grained case in which both resources can be
               sought simultaneously. In both cases, each consumer in the
               absence of its competitor would evolve as a generalist. In
               competition, each consumer will coevolve as a specialist on a
               different resource patch type in the coarse-grained case, or, in
               the fine-grained environment, each consumer will become more
               specialized on one resource although not necessarily completely
               so. In the fine-grained case, it is possible for two generalists
               to coexist, but co-evolution will lead to character divergence.
               For the cases considered, the co-evolved divergence of the
               consumers leads to greater global stability of the consumer
               community even though it has negligible effect on the local
               Lyapunov stability. The increased community stability results
               from natural selection acting on individuals in the separate
               consumer populations. No group selection at either the
               population or community level is necessary.",

              concepts has been a key driver in ecological research from the
              inception of the field. Despite the tremendous effort put into
              this area, progress has been limited due to the bewildering
              number of metrics used to describe ecological stability. Here, we
              seek to resolve some of the confusion by unfolding the dynamics
              of a simple consumer-resource interaction module. In what
              follows, we first review common dynamical metrics of stability
              (CV, eigenvalues). We argue using the classical type II
              consumer-resource model as an example where the empirical
              stability metric, CV, hides two different, but important, aspects
              of stability: (i) stability due to mean population density
              processes and (ii) stability due to population density variance
              processes. We then employ a simple stochastic consumer-resource
              framework in order to elucidate (i) when we expect these two
              different aspects of stability to arise in ecological systems
              and, importantly, highlight (ii) the fact that these two
              different aspects of stability respond differentially, but
              predictably, to changes in fundamental parameters that govern
              biomass flux and loss in any consumer-resource interaction (e.g.,

               (endotherm, vertebrate ectotherm, invertebrate ectotherm, or
               plant) of the populations in question. The remaining parameters
               have clear biological meanings. The intent of these models is to
               provide maximum realism from minimum data when needed because of
               constraints of time or of resources for empirical research. The
               models also demonstrate the influence of physiological power and
               body size on consumer-resource dynamics. For a given metabolic
               type, we define ecological scope as the ratio of maximal
               ingestion rate to respiration rate. Invertebrate ectotherms have
               greater ecological scope than do vertebrate ectotherms, which

@ARTICLE{Schluter2000,
  title    = "Ecological Character Displacement in Adaptive Radiation",
  author   = "Schluter, Dolph",
  abstract = "abstract: I give an overview of the observational and
              experimental evidence for ecological character displacement in
              adaptive radiation. Sixty‐one published cases of character
              displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make
              up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence, even
              though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically
              possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when
              displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric
              (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric resource
              distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly
              overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups,
              with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five
              hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the possibility
              that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on
              position in food webs. Overall, the quality and completeness of
              observational data has improved in recent years, as judged by the
              extent to which individual cases satisfy six standard criteria.
              All but one of the criteria are met in over half the cases. Most
              often lacking is independent evidence that the species involved
              compete for resources. For this reason, we cannot be sure that
              divergence in sympatry is usually the result of resource
              competition rather than some other interaction. Field experiments
              on character displacement, which explore how interaction strength
              changes per unit change in phenotypic traits, are only just
              beginning. I summarize research on threespine sticklebacks that
              used experiments in ponds to test three predictions: that
              present‐day differences between sympatric species are a ``ghost''
              of competition past; that adding a competitor alters natural
              selection pressures on a species already present, favoring
              divergence; and that divergent natural selection stemming from
              resource competition is frequency dependent. In total, the
              evidence suggests that character displacement occurs frequently
              in nature, and it probably plays an important role in the
              evolution of diversity in many adaptive radiations.",

              coastal British Columbia. Geological data suggest that the
              populations resulted from multiple divergence and speciation
              events over the past 13,000 yr. In lakes with two species, one is
              invariably ``limnetic'' in morphology and habitat, and the other
              is ``benthic.'' Other lakes contain a single form morphologically
              intermediate between sympatric species and exploiting both
              habitat's. Within solitary populations individuals exploit one
              habitat or the other according to their morphology, which
              underscores the divergent selection pressures operating on either
              side of the habitat boundary. Our results satisfy at least four
              of the six major criteria for demonstrating the occurrence of
              character displacement: (1) a statistical null model of no
              displacement is easily rejected; (2) variation between and within

              similar forms; and (4) morphology is closely linked to resource
              use. Minimal resource differences between one- and two-species
              lakes and the presence of competition between similar phenotypes
              are still to be established. Our data suggest that competition
              for food has played a critical role in the divergence between
              species. We consider the possibility that it also helped in

  abstract = "This paper analyzes the adaptive responses to competition (both
              character displacement and niche shift) in a two consumer-two
              resource model. The model includes density dependence that is
              unrelated to the resources that are explicit in the model. This
              could be due to another resource dimension, parasites, or
              interference competition. Competitors adapt by changing their
              relative consumption rate constants on the two resource types.
              This model can result in mutually divergent, parallel, or
              mutually convergent displacement of competitors. Parallel
              displacement may entail net divergence, net convergence, or no
              net change. Parallel change with net convergence is most likely
              when the competitors have similar constraints on the possible
              values of consumption rate constants, unequal allopatric
              abundances, and significant intraspecific density dependence.
              Numerical calculations of displacements are presented for several
              models and the effect of a number of different possible
              alterations of the model are discussed. The evolution of resource
              handling and processing efficiency, and displacement in the
              presence of additional selective pressures on the character are
              considered in detail. The results have implications for questions

              character displacement and the competition coefficient, and
              ``null'' models in the study of competition. Differences between
              this and previous theoretical works are discussed. It is argued

              not biologically unlikely, and possible examples are discussed.

               The first model is identical to that of Slatkin (1980) but we
               extend his analysis. The second model allows for the evolution
               of all niche attributes that affect interspecific competition
               along a resource axis. These are: the mean position of each
               species along the axis, the variation in position between
               phenotypes within each species, and the width of resources used
               by each phenotype. In addition, explicit dynamics for the
               resources are included in the model. This model predicts that
               character displacement can occur in coevolutionary communities.
               It also predicts that the relative niche separations between
               species (d/w ratios; d = distance between peaks of two species'
               niches on the resource (niche) axis, w = total niche width of a

@ARTICLE{Schluter1993,
  title    = "Adaptive Radiation in Sticklebacks: Size, Shape, and Habitat Use
              Efficiency",
  author   = "Schluter, Dolph",
  abstract = "I examined habitat use efficiencies of two morphologically
              distinct threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.). The species
              make up one of several coexisting pairs that apparently formed in
              the past 13 000 yr in coastal British Columbia lakes. Previous
              comparative work has shown that morphology and habitat use are
              correlated within and among populations. Sticklebacks occurring
              alone in lakes are intermediate in morphology and habitat use,
              suggesting that differences between the sympatric species result
              from ecological character displacement. I tested two hypotheses
              to explain these patterns, and which are implicit in general
              views of the causes of adaptive radiation: (1) Each resource
              (habitat) subjects its species to unique selection pressures,
              owing to the advantages of certain combinations of traits for
              foraging; (2) Phenotypes intermediate between habitat specialists
              suffer a competitive disadvantage. These hypotheses were
              evaluated by measuring the foraging rates of the two species and
              their interspecific hybrids in the two main habitats (benthos and
              open water) provided in the laboratory. Efficiencies of habitat
              exploitation matched obeserved morphological differences. In the
              benthic habitat the larger, deeper bodies species (having also a
              wide mouth and few short gill rakers) was superior to the
              smaller, more slender species (having a narrow mouth and many
              long gill rakers). Success of hybrids was intermediate. This rank
              order of species efficiencies was reversed in the open water
              habitat. These results support the hypothesis that different
              traits are favored in different habitats, and that adaptation to
              one habitat has occurred at the expense of feeding rate in the
              other. Average foraging success of hybrids in the two habitats
              fell near to below the average of the two parental species,
              suggesting natural selection against intermediate phenotypes.
              Foraging efficiency in open water was greatest in the smaller
              size classes of fish, hinting that small size of the open water
              species is the result of selection for high foraging efficiency.
              However, size could not explain most differences in feeding
              efficiency between species, and it is likely that many traits
              contribute.",

@ARTICLE{Law1979,
  title    = "Optimal Life Histories Under {Age-Specific} Predation",
  author   = "Law, Richard",
  abstract = "If a predator crops prey of certain ages in preference to others,
              it may be acting as an agent of selection, causing genetic change
              in the prey population. This paper adapts a model of life-history
              evolution to investigate some selective consequences of several
              patterns of age-specific predation. The model allows allocation
              of resources to reproduction, growth, and maintenance in an age
              class i to be varied. Subject to several assumptions, it is shown
              that increasing predation on individuals younger than i leads to
              selection for lower rates of reproduction at age i. Conversely,
              increasing predation on individuals older than and/or equal to i
              leads to selection for greater rates of reproduction. If
              individuals from both these age ranges are cropped the optimal
              rate of reproduction may either increase or decrease. The only
              circumstance under which no change occurs arises if all
              individuals irrespective of age are liable to be cropped, or if
              the effects of predation on younger and older age classes exactly
              cancel one another. The implications of these results to the
              management of populations exploited by man are discussed.",
