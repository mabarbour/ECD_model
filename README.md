# ECD_model
This repository contains code to reproduce the results reported in the manuscript, "Ecological character displacement destabilizes food webs", which has been accepted at *The American Naturalist*.

Most file names should be self-explanatory. The files *CR_dynamics.R*, *Consumer_Resource_Functions.R*, *eco_evo_sim_function.R*, and *identify_steady_state.R* are the workhorse functions for conducting the eco-evolutionary simulations. All *.csv* files and files in the folder *manuscript_ECD_model_cache* are output from the simulations that I saved in order to avoid repeating simulations everytime I knit the manuscript together. Note that *.nb* files require Mathematica to open and explore.

Please open an issue in this repository if there is any confusion or errors in the code.
